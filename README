Virtual Pollution Intelligence Grid

AI-powered environmental risk forecasting and anomaly detection system built using pollutant datasets (PM2.5, PM10, NO2).
This software-only platform simulates pollution severity, models spatial spread, forecasts 7-day trends, and generates dynamic high-alert reports for decision support.
